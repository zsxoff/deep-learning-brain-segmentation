# Deep Learning Brain Segmentation

> Brain segmentation for the 2D images using convolutional neural network.

---

This notebook presents the segmentation of brain regions in a 2D grayscale image.

The work was done on a dataset [Neurite OASIS Sample Data](https://github.com/adalca/medical-datasets/blob/master/neurite-oasis.md).

This notebook shows the result of a 4- and 24-label segmentation. See dataset link for full description.
